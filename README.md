# GRU Implemntation on Saudi stock market 

## Brief introduction to Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN ) 
We can define RNN as a class of artificial neural network where connections between nodes form a directed graph along a temporal sequence; to semplify more. A recurrent neural network can be thought of as multiple copies of the same network, each passing a message to a successor.

## What about GRU 
Stand for Gated Recurrent Unit , The GRU is like a long short-term memory (LSTM) with forget gate but has fewer parameters than LSTM, aims to solve the vanishing gradient problem which comes with a standard recurrent neural network.

## This project 
This is first attemp at recurrent neural network , and I started with GRU because it solve the problem of vanishing gradient . 
this implemntation was done by Jupyter Python and all the steps and compiling is available
